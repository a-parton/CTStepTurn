Description: This package provides the range of functions required for carrying 
    out full Bayesian inference on continuous-time step-and-turn movement models.
    Given observed animal locations, single- and multi-state movement can be inferred
    for movement models assuming either independent or correlated step processes. 
    Inference can be carried out in the presence or absence of observation error, 
    with this error process either being independent of correlated in time.
